# Reading on the Pitch Demo

Around the world, children waiting to find a new home in refugee camps will be given the opportunity to learn the language of their host countries interactively, by playing Football (the universal language). Instructors at different camps can run this program with a small amount of training, by watching training videos created and hosted by Reading on The Pitch (readingonthepitch.org) 

The first goal of the application will be to provide the instructors the opportunity to download the
se training videos in the relevant language so that they can be later accessed on site, with limited or no internet access.

The program runs several weeks, and over the course of the program instructors are asked to submit data regarding their students progress at three different points, or weekly if the instructor sees fit. Program administrators will then review the data so that they can adjust and update the curriculum based off of this feedback.

The second goal of the application is to provide a system where instructors can create and send reports regarding the progress of all of their students. This feature enables the instructors to assess the students individually, as well as in a group, in order to know what areas to focus in on. This data should then be converted into an easy to read format, utilizing graphs and charts, and administrators should be given access.
